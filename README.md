# Defect Detection of Submersible Pump Impellers Produced By Casting Method Using Convolutional Neural Networks
The casting method is used while producing the submersible pump impeller. Casting is a
manufacturing process in which a liquid material is poured into a mold, usually containing
a hollow space of the desired shape, and then allowed to solidify. Various quality defects
may occur due to the casting method. To detect these defects, defect detection was made
using convolutional neural networks (CNN), one of the image processing techniques.
Preparations such as standardization, panning, zooming, turning, rotating, and changing
the brightness were made in the preprocessing phase. Classification of faulty and errorfree pump impellers of the model resulted in a 97.34% success rate
